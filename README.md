File Structure
journal.py: The main file for running the journaling app.
journals.json: The JSON file that stores the journal entries.
Data Persistence
Journal entries are saved in the journals.json file. Each entry consists of a title, content, and timestamp. The file is updated whenever a new entry is created or deleted.

# Example of a journal entry in the JSON file:

json
Copy code
{
  "entries": [
    {
      "title": "Learning Python",
      "content": "Today I learned Python!",
      "timestamp": "2024-12-08T14:30:00"
    }
  ]
}
